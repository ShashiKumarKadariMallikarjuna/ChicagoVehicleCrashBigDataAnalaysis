# ChicagoVehicleCrashBigDataAnalaysis

The modern issue of escalating traffic challenges demands a more informed approach to
effective solutions. This project aims to closely examine road traffic details in Chicago,
focusing on utilizing crash data to provide a comprehensive view of traffic safety and
congestion. The crash data encompasses information on every traffic crash within the City of
Chicago under the jurisdiction of the Chicago Police Department (CPD). The data, sourced
from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, is displayed on the data portal
without personally identifiable information. Records are added to the portal upon finalization of
a crash report or amendments to an existing one in E-Crash. To achieve project objectives,
various Amazon web service (AWS) cloud resources, including Amazon Simple Storage
Service (S3) buckets, Glue, Redshift, and Athena, are deployed to enable efficient data staging
and processing through file drops and Application programming interface (API) integration.
The data undergoes meticulous processing to ensure quality and completeness, resulting in a
dataset available for exploration and analysis. A user-friendly front-end application, powered by
AWS QuickSight offers stakeholders an intuitive interface to explore and visualize street-level
information. The application's rich features allow stakeholders to interact with the data,
extracting insights relevant to their needs. The project's outcomes are highly relevant for urban
planning and public safety. By leveraging historical and real-time data, the project provides a
valuable resource for decision-makers to inform choices about traffic management, road safety,
and urban planning. The project's approach and outcomes can benefit businesses, academics,
and practitioners in transportation and urban planning, offering a framework for addressing road
traffic safety in cities.
